// File Format:
// 
// The text file can contain whitespace characters, comments (C-style),
// and binary ($readmemb) or hexadecimal ($readmemh) data values.  Both
// types of data values can contain x or X, z or Z, and the underscore
// character.
// 
// The data values are assigned to memory words from left to right,
// beginning at start_addr or the left array bound (the default).  The
// next address to load may be specified in the file itself using @hhhhhh, 
// where h is a hexadecimal character.  Spaces between the @ and the address 
// character are not allowed.  It shall be an error if there are too many 
// words in the file or if an address is outside the bounds of the array.
// 
// Modified to contain the requested 32-bit values starting at address 0x0:
// Decimal values: -1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6, -7, -8, 9, -10
// 
FFFFFFFF // Address 0x0: -1 in 32-bit two's complement
00000002 // Address 0x1: 2
FFFFFFFD // Address 0x2: -3 in 32-bit two's complement  
00000004 // Address 0x3: 4
00000005 // Address 0x4: 5
00000006 // Address 0x5: 6
FFFFFFF9 // Address 0x6: -7 in 32-bit two's complement
FFFFFFF8 // Address 0x7: -8 in 32-bit two's complement
00000009 // Address 0x8: 9
FFFFFFF6 // Address 0x9: -10 in 32-bit two's complement

// Note: This memory is word-addressable, so each address represents 
// a 32-bit word, not individual bytes as in typical RISC-V memory
